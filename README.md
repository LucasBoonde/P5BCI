# P5BCI
Github for the P5 ROB Project:

Within this repository lies the entire catkin_workspace used for the Gazebo simulation of the Kinova Robot. Within the catkin_ws lies the scripts for the Python BCI and Eyetracking packages and the Kinova Gazebo/MoveIt packages. 

The 2 standalone BCI python scripts are added so that windows pc's could run the BCI without having to run the entire ROS environment as well.
