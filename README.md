# P5BCI
Github for the P5 ROB Project:

In this folder is the entire catkin_workspace for the project. Within it lies the BCI python package, the Eye tracking python package and the Kinova gazebo / moveit packages. The two stand alone BCI scripts are meant for running the BCI isolated on a windows machine.
